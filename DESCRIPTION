Description: Computes power, or sample size or the detectable difference for a repeated measures model with attrition. It requires the variance covariance matrix of the observations but can compute this matrix for several common random effects models. See Diggle, P, Liang, KY and Zeger, SL (1994, ISBN:9780198522843).
