\title{
Creates the xMatrix and zMatrix, and attrition rates for a two treatment clinical trial analyzed using the random slopes model.
}
\description{
In the random slopes model each patient has a linear trajectory over time with a random intercept and slope. The intercepts are assumed to be the same for each of two treatment groups and the treatment effect is measured by the difference in average slopes.
}
\usage{
randomSlopesMatrix(visit, vs, sigma2, dropPerMonth,baselineTreatment=FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{visit}{
A vector of visit times or a list of two visit time vectors if the treatments have different visit times.
}
  \item{vs}{
The variance covariance matrix of the intercept and slope random effects.
}
  \item{sigma2}{
The error variance.
}
  \item{dropPerMonth}{
Either a single number which is the attrition rate or a vector of attrition rates for each visit. Note this would have length one less than the number of visits since the attrition after the last visit would not be used.
}
  \item{baselineTreatment}{A logical indicating whether their treatment is in the model as a main effect. In a random slopes model the effect or treatment is measured by the treatment-time interaction.

  }
}
\details{
This calculates the matrices for the random slopes model
\eqn{y_{t}=\mu+\beta_1 t+ \beta_2 t*I(\rm{rx}=1)+u+b t+\sigma^2 \epsilon},
where \eqn{u,b,\epsilon} are random variables. Note that a treatment main effect is not included in the model by default, because in a randomized study the treatments should be the same at the baseline visit. This practice may vary.
